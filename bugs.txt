bugs in CSS:
  1. Line 7: There was no dash between background and color 
  2. Line 14: added the position because in line 40 .left is used and we can't use it with the default position so we have to change it

bugs in JavaScript:
  1. Line 31: The id usedd was incorrect it was written as "name" and not "nameInput"
  2. Line 37: The word style was misspelt as styel with no dot before it and it was not specified for the body
  3. Line 39: The id used was incorrect it was written as "boxx" with 2 x instead of just one 
  4. Line 42: Added the if condition so it stops when counter reaches 10 (i didn't know what the purpose of counter==10 is, i figured it was to stop it)
